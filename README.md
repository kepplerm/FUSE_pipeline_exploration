# Exploration of FUSE pipeline

Through the jupyter notebook contained in this repository I will explore the FUSE pipeline step by step. Each routine and subroutine will be tested seperately on some archival test data.  

The FUSE pipeline is written in C. The corresponding commands will be executed over a Python wrapper. The FUSE pipeline is very modular so each step can be executed seperately.
